_Git is awesome, GitHub is awesome, and Jekyll is awesome!_

I'm glad I started the journey of [Git](git-scm.com), [GitHub](github.com) and [Jekyll](jekyllrb.com). Git is a terrific tool to write code, and GitHub is a perfect online repository manager, which also provides top-notch free hosting, powered by Jekyll, an awesome static site builder.
