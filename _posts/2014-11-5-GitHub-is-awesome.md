_Git is awesome, GitHub is awesome, and Jekyll is awesome!_

I'm glad I started the journey of [Git], [GitHub] and [Jekyll]. [Git] is a terrific tool to write code, and [GitHub] is a perfect online repository manager, which also provides top-notch free hosting, powered by [Jekyll], an awesome static site builder featured by theming capability using [Liquid].

Being my first blog on GitHub,
